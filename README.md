# Volatility Forecasting and Regime Detection using HMM

This project validates Gaussian HMMs for:
- volatility forecasting
- volatility band coverage
- regime prediction accuracy

## Structure
- run_vol_validation.py
- report_vol_validation.py
- run_regime_validation.py
- report_regime_validation.py
- scripts contain core HMM logic

## Data
Data is fetched programmatically (no data files included).

## Results
See generated PNG figures and Excel summaries.
